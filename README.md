# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

While not a full application, Tweeter showcases the basic functionalities of Twitter and allows the user to
create tweets on the fly. The application uses error handling validation for tweets, displays the time since a
tweet was posted and dymanically updates the page as new tweets are created.
